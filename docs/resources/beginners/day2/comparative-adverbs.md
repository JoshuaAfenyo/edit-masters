# Comparative Adverbs

## 🏃‍♂️ Comparative Adverbs

### 🔹 What Are Comparative Adverbs?

One of the jobs of an [**adverb**](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/adverbs.php){ target="_blank" } is to modify a **verb action**, for example:

> Joe ran **fast**.

If we want to compare one verb action with another, we can use a **comparative adverb**, for example:

> Joe ran fast, but Mary came first because she ran **faster**.

We use **comparative adverbs** when talking about **two actions** (not three or more).  
👉 Comparison is always between **two things**.

## ⚙️ How Do We Make Comparative Adverbs?

There are **three basic ways** to make or *form* a comparative adverb:

---

### 1️⃣ One-syllable adverbs: add **-er**

If an adverb has only **one syllable**, we usually just add **-er** to make it comparative:  
`fast → faster`

**Examples:**

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="../images/comparative_adverbs_1.PNG"
       alt="Irregular Verb List"
       style="max-width: 90%; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
</div>

> ⚠️ Note: Most one-syllable adverbs have the same form as their equivalent adjectives.  
> Don’t let this confuse you!  
> Example:
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="../images/comparative_adverbs_2.PNG"
       alt="Irregular Verb List"
       style="max-width: 90%; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
</div>

---

### 2️⃣ Two-syllable (or longer) adverbs: use **more**

When an adverb has **two or more syllables** (like all *-ly* adverbs),  
we make it comparative by adding **more** in front:

`quickly → more quickly`

**Examples:**

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="../images/comparative_adverbs_3.PNG"
       alt="Irregular Verb List"
       style="max-width: 90%; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
</div>

We can also use **less** in place of **more** to suggest a **reduction** in the action.

**Examples:**

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="../images/comparative_adverbs_4.PNG"
       alt="Irregular Verb List"
       style="max-width: 90%; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
</div>

---

### 3️⃣ Irregular Adverbs

A few adverbs have **irregular comparative forms**, for example:

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="../images/comparative_adverbs_5.PNG"
       alt="Irregular Verb List"
       style="max-width: 90%; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
</div>

## 💬 Comparative Adverbs with Informal Forms

Some adverbs have both a **formal (“correct”) form** with *-ly*  
and an **informal form** without *-ly*.

Although native speakers may use the informal forms in speech,  
they should be **avoided in formal writing or exams**.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="../images/comparative_adverbs_6.PNG"
       alt="Irregular Verb List"
       style="max-width: 90%; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
</div>
---

### 🚫 Adverbs with *No Comparative Form*

Some adverbs **cannot be compared**. Examples include:

again, first

daily, yesterday

here, there

now, then

never, sometimes

## 🧠 How Do We Use Comparative Adverbs?

Now that you know how to **form** comparative adverbs,  
let’s see how to **use** them in sentences.

> Notice that we use **more** to show an *increase* in the action,  
> and **less** to show a *decrease*.  
> Also note that the comparative adverb is often followed by **than**.

**Examples:**

- Trains go fast, but planes go **faster**.  
- Planes go **faster than** trains.  
- Trains don’t go **faster than** planes.  
- Trains go **more slowly than** planes.  
- Planes go **less slowly than** trains.  
- Joe won because he played **better than** Jane.  
- Did cities grow **more quickly** after the Industrial Revolution?  
- He hit the ball **more powerfully than** his competitor.  
- As we get older, we remember things **less easily**.  
- Could you talk a bit **more quietly**, please?  
- Could you talk a bit **less loudly**, please?  
- I can’t hear you — please speak **louder / more loudly**.

### 🌍 Comparing Groups

Although we use comparative adverbs when talking about **two actions**,  
one or both of those actions may represent a **group**.

> The planet **Mercury** revolves around the sun **faster than all the other planets**.

Here, we are comparing **one action (Mercury’s)** to **one other group of actions (all the other planets)**.

---

> ✅ **Summary:**  
> Use *-er* for short adverbs,  
> *more/less* for long adverbs,  
> and remember the irregulars (*better, worse, farther*).
