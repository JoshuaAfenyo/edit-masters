# Adjective Gradability


Adjectives describe **qualities (characteristics)** of nouns.  
Some qualities can vary in intensity or *grade*, for example:

> rather hot, hot, very hot  
> hot, hotter, the hottest

The adjective **hot** is *gradable*.

Other qualities cannot vary in intensity or grade because they are:

- **Extremes** (for example: *freezing*)  
- **Absolutes** (for example: *dead*)  
- **Classifying** (for example: *nuclear*)

The adjectives *freezing*, *dead* and *nuclear* are **non-gradable**.

## 🟢 Gradable Adjectives

A **gradable adjective** can be used with *grading adverbs* that vary the adjective's grade or intensity.  
Look at these examples:

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="../images/adjective-gradability_2.PNG"
       alt="Irregular Verb List"
       style="max-width: 90%; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
</div>

> “Gradable adjectives” are also called **qualitative adjectives**.  
> “Grading adverbs” are also called **submodifiers**.

A gradable adjective can also have **comparative** and **superlative** forms:

- big → bigger → the biggest  
- hot → hotter → the hottest  
- important → more important → the most important  

**Example sentences:**

> My teacher was **very happy** with my homework.  
> That website is **reasonably popular**. But this one is **more popular**.  
> He said that France was **a little cold** and Denmark was **rather cold**. But Sweden was **the coldest**.

## 🔴 Non-gradable Adjectives

A **non-gradable adjective** cannot be used with grading adverbs:

> ~~It was rather freezing outside.~~  
> ~~The dog was very dead.~~  
> ~~He is investing in slightly nuclear energy.~~

Non-gradable adjectives do not normally have **comparative** and **superlative** forms:

> freezing → ~~more freezing → the most freezing~~

> dead → ~~deader → the deadest~~

> nuclear → ~~more nuclear → the most nuclear~~   


🧠 **Tip:** Don't try to learn lists of gradable and non-gradable adjectives! It's better to understand what makes an adjective gradable or non-gradable. This is a matter of logic and common sense. Most native-speakers have never heard of gradable and non-gradable adjectives. They just "feel" that it doesn't make sense to say "~~fairly excellent~~" or "~~very unique~~". You probably have the same idea in your language.  

**Often, non-gradable adjectives are used alone:**

> It was **freezing** outside.  
> The dog was **dead**.  
> He is investing in **nuclear** energy.

### Non-grading Adverbs

A **non-gradable adjective** can be used with "non-grading adverbs" (which usually just give the adjective extra impact), for example:

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="../images/adjective-gradability_3.PNG"
       alt="Irregular Verb List"
       style="max-width: 90%; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
</div>

Here are some example sentences containing non-grading adverbs with non-gradable adjectives:

> Her exam results were **absolutely awful**. She will have to take the exam again.  
> Is there anything like it in the world? It must be **virtually unique**.  
> It starts an **essentially chemical** reaction.

Some adjectives have more than one meaning or sense.  
It’s possible for the **same adjective** to be gradable in one sense and non-gradable in another.
