## 🔤 **Subject and Predicate**

!!! tip "Structure of a Sentence"
• Every **sentence** consists of a **subject** and a **predicate**.  

• The **subject** of a sentence designates the person, place or thing that the sentence is about;  
  the **predicate** is that which is said of the subject.  

• The **simple subject** of a sentence is a **noun** or **pronoun**.  
  The **simple predicate** of a sentence is a **verb** or **verb phrase**.  

• The **simple subject** is the main noun or pronoun that the sentence is about.  
  When combined with all the other words that explain, modify or complete its meaning, it forms the **complete subject**.  

   • The **simple predicate** is the main verb or verb phrase that asserts something about the subject.  
     When combined with all the other words that explain, modify or complete its meaning, it forms the **complete predicate**.  

   • A **compound subject** or **predicate** consists of two or more simple subjects or predicates, joined, when necessary, by **conjunctions**.  

   • Either the **subject** or the **predicate**, or both, may be **compound**.

## 🧱 **The Parts of Speech**

In accordance with their use in a sentence, words are divided into **eight parts of speech**:  
**nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.**

---

### 1️⃣ **Nouns and Pronouns**

(1) A **noun** is the name of a person, place or thing.  

(2) A **pronoun** is a word used instead of a noun.  
It designates a person, place or thing without naming it.  

**Nouns** and **pronouns** are called **substantives**.  
The substantive to which a pronoun refers is called its **antecedent**.

---

### 2️⃣ **Adjectives**

(3) An **adjective** is a word that **describes or limits** a substantive.  
This is usually done by indicating a **specific quality**.  

An adjective is said to **“belong”** to the substantive that it describes or limits.  

An adjective that describes is called a **descriptive adjective**;  
one that points out or designates is called a **definitive adjective**.  

An **article** is considered an adjective.  
‘**A**’ or ‘**an**’ are **indefinite articles** used to denote a nonspecific substantive.  
‘**The**’ is a **definite article** used to denote a specific substantive.

---

### 3️⃣ **Verbs**

(4) A **verb** is a word that **asserts something** (usually an action) concerning a person, place or thing.  

Some verbs express a **state or condition** rather than an action.  
A group of words that is used as a verb is called a **verb phrase**.  

Certain verbs, when used to make verb-phrases, are called **auxiliary (or aiding) verbs**,  
because they help other verbs to express an action or a state.  

**Is** (in its various forms) and several other verbs may be used to frame sentences in which  
a word or words in the predicate describe or define the subject.  
In such sentences, *is* and other verbs used for the same purpose are called **copulative (or linking) verbs**.  

The **infinitive** is a verb form that can act as a noun or a modifier and is commonly preceded by the preposition **to**,  
which is indicative of the infinitive form.  

The **participle** is a verb form that has no subject and acts like an adjective.  
It expresses an action or a state in such a way as to describe or limit a substantive.  

A participle is said to **“belong”** to the substantive that it describes or limits.  

The two main types of participles are **present participles** and **past participles**, based on the time that they denote.

---

### 4️⃣ **Adverbs**

(5) An **adverb** is a word that **modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb.**  

A word or group of words that changes or modifies the meaning of another word is called a **modifier**.  
**Adjectives** and **adverbs** are both modifiers.

---

### 5️⃣ **Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Interjections**

(6) A **preposition** is a word placed before a substantive to show its **relation** to another word in the sentence.  
The substantive that follows a preposition is called its **object**.  

(7) A **conjunction** connects words or groups of words.  

(8) An **interjection** is a cry or other exclamatory sound expressing an **emotion**,  
such as surprise, anger or pleasure.

---

### 🧾 **Additional Notes**

• The meaning of a word in a sentence determines the part of speech to which it belongs.  
• The same word may sometimes be one part of speech, and sometimes another, particularly with **infinitives** and **participles**.  
• **Inflection** is a change in the form of a word indicating a difference in its meaning.  
  A word thus changed in form is said to be **inflected**.  
• The inflection of a substantive is called its **declension**;  
  that of an adjective or an adverb its **comparison**;  
  that of a verb its **conjugation**.

## 🧩 **Phrases**

!!! abstract "Definition"
    A **phrase** is a group of connected words that does not contain a subject or a predicate.

A phrase is equivalent to a part of speech:  

• A phrase used as a **noun** is called a **noun phrase**.  
• A phrase used as a **verb** is called a **verb phrase**.  
• A phrase used as an **adjective** is called an **adjective phrase**.  
• A phrase used as an **adverb** is called an **adverbial phrase**.  

Adjective or adverbial phrases consisting of a preposition and its object,  
with or without other words, are called **prepositional phrases**.

---

## 🔗 **Clauses**

A **clause** is a group of words that forms part of a sentence and contains a subject and a predicate.  

A clause used as a part of speech is called a **subordinate clause**.  
All other clauses are called **independent clauses**.  

Clauses of the same order or rank are said to be **coordinate clauses**.

---

## 📘 **Types of Sentences**

• Sentences may be **simple**, **compound**, **complex**, or **compound-complex**.  
• A **simple sentence** has only one subject and one predicate, either or both of which may be compound.  
• A **compound sentence** consists of two or more independent coordinate clauses, which may or may not be joined by conjunctions.  
• A **complex sentence** consists of two or more clauses, one of which is independent and the rest subordinate.  
• A **compound sentence** in which one or more of the coordinate clauses are complex is called a **compound-complex sentence**.

---

## 🧠 **Subordinate Clauses**

• **Subordinate clauses**, like phrases, are used as parts of speech.  
  They serve as substitutes for **nouns**, **adjectives**, or **adverbs**.  
• A subordinate clause that is used as a **noun** is called a **noun (or substantive) clause**.  
• A subordinate clause that modifies a substantive is called an **adjective clause**.  
• A subordinate clause that serves as an adverbial modifier is called an **adverbial clause**.
