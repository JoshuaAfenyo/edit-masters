## Six Preposition Rules

Prepositions form a small but very important word class. We use prepositions very frequently. In fact, the prepositions **to**, **of**, **in**, **for**, **on**, **with**, **at**, **by**, **from** are all in the top 25 words in English. If you can understand and correctly use prepositions, it will greatly improve your fluency. And remember, there are not very many prepositions. There are only [**150 prepositions**](https://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/prepositions/list.htm){target ="_blank" }, and we only use about [**70 of these commonly**](https://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/prepositions-list.htm){target ="_blank"}. The following rules will help you understand and use prepositions correctly.

### 1. A preposition must have an object

All prepositions have objects. If a "preposition" does not have an object it is not a preposition—it's probably an adverb.  
A preposition **always** has an object.  
An adverb **never** has an object.  

Look at these example sentences:

- They are **in the kitchen**. (preposition *in* has object *the kitchen*)  
- Please come **in**. (adverb *in* has no object; it qualifies *come*)  
- There was a doorway **before me**. (preposition *before* has object *me*)  
- I had never seen it **before**. (adverb *before* has no object; it qualifies *seen*)  
- I will call **after work**. (preposition *after* has object *work*)  
- He called soon **after**. (adverb *after* has no object; it qualifies *called*)

### 2. pre-position means place before

The name **“preposition”** indicates that a preposition (usually) comes before something (its object):

> I put it **in the box**.

But even when a preposition does not come before its object, it is still closely related to its object:

> Who did you talk **to**? / I talked **to Jane**.

### 3. A pronoun following a preposition should be in object form

The noun or pronoun that follows a preposition forms a **prepositional object**.  
If it is a pronoun, it should therefore be in the **objective form** (*me, her, them*), not **subjective form** (*I, she, they*):

- This is from my wife and **me**.  
- That’s between **him and her**.  
- Mary gave it to **them**.

### 4. Preposition forms

Prepositions have no particular form.  
The majority of prepositions are one-word prepositions, but some are two- or three-word phrases known as **complex prepositions**:

- *one-word prepositions:* **before, into, on**  
- *complex prepositions:* **according to, but for, in spite of, on account of**

### 5. to preposition and to infinitive are not the same

Do not confuse the infinitive particle **“to”** (*to sing, to live*) with the preposition **“to”** (*to London, to me*).

#### to as preposition

- I look forward **to lunch**  
- I look forward **to seeing you**  
- ~~I look forward to see you~~
- They are committed **to the project.**  
- They are committed **to keeping the price down.**  
- ~~They are committed to keep the price down.~~  
- I am used **to cars.**  
- I am used **to driving.**  
- ~~I am used to drive.~~

#### to as infinitive particle

- They used **to live in Moscow.**  
- They love **to sing.**

### 6. The golden preposition rule

A preposition is followed by a **"noun"**.  
It is **NEVER** followed by a verb.
